# Economic Simulation Game for Students

## Project Description
The Economic Simulation Game is a decentralized application designed to teach students the basics of economics, investment, and trading using blockchain technology. Through this game, students can register, receive virtual tokens, invest, trade, and earn rewards. The goal is to engage students in learning economic principles through interactive simulation and decentralized finance (DeFi) mechanics.

## Contract Address
- Contract Address: **0x905E95490A5Af5C06A585f990E78F0b94cFDE84a

## Project Vision
The vision of the Economic Simulation Game is to create an engaging and educational platform for students to understand and practice economic concepts in a simulated, risk-free environment. By integrating blockchain technology, students can gain hands-on experience in the world of decentralized finance, virtual trading, and digital assets. The project aims to provide a dynamic and interactive learning tool that encourages practical learning while fostering financial literacy.

## Key Features
- **Player Registration**: Students can sign up to the game and receive an initial balance of virtual tokens.
- **Investment Mechanism**: Players can invest their tokens in virtual assets or economic activities and earn rewards.
- **Reward System**: Players can claim rewards based on their activities, simulating real-world economic outcomes.
- **Token Transfers**: Players can transfer tokens to other users, encouraging economic interaction and trade.
- **Decentralized**: The game operates on a blockchain, ensuring transparency and security in all transactions and activities.
- **Educational Tool**: Helps students learn economic and financial principles through practical involvement in a virtual economy.
